# Bug-Tracking-Database
Designed a database using MS SQL for tracking bugs in applications and created ER diagrams using forward engineering. Normalized the database to 3NF efficiently and divided data into subject-based tables to reduce the redundancy. Used stored procedures to create incidents and store default values and used triggers to properly handle the events
